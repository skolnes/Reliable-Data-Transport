   The academic integrity pledge can be found on page 3 of
   the document found here: https://www.sandiego.edu/conduct/documents/HonorCode.pdf
   To be clear, it is the text that starts, "I pledge to demonstrate...".

  I pledge to demonstrate personal and academic integrity in all matters with
  my
  fellow students, the faculty, and the administration here at USD. I promise
  to be
  honest and accountable for my actions; and to uphold the statutes of
  scholastic
  honesty to better myself and those around me. 

3. The estimated number of hours spent working on the project.
   Break this down into three categories:
		- Time spent partner 1 spent working alone: 5
		- Time spent partner 2 spent working alone: 3
		- Time spent working together: 8

4. A list of missing features and/or known bugs.

	We know the checksum is not accurate

5. Did you need to spend a project buck on this project to get a one week
   deadline extension? (y/n)

   Both my partner and I are not going to do project 5 so we will be using
   that as an extension for the project, so no project buck.

6. Any feedback you with to give me relating the project (e.g. Was it
   interesting? How could it be improved?)
